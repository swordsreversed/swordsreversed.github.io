Can't believe I didn't post this earlier. Best best best.

    "Much-needed vinyl upgrade for this fantastic cassette from this Brisbane loner: a series of zoned hand-percussion, guitar and F/X jags that come over like Michael Rother plays sun-up by the Ganges with Bobby Beausoleil. There’s a heady kraut vibe to much of it, though the way it slow-burns through wah-wah guitar and MacLise-style raindrop drone and opens up into visions of high gothic keyboard excess feels more like a fantasy of Kraut that is less period-specific and more freely hallucinated. Throw in some of the vertical ascension style of the recent Flower-Campbell duo sets and you have a major stone, love this, highly recommended."
